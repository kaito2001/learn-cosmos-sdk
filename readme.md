# VBICOSMOSBASIC
**VBICOSMOSBASIC** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and CometBFT consensus and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

Born with the goal of making it easy for everyone to get acquainted and master the Cosmos platform. 
In Group 1 (Basic), learners will understand the basic concept of Cosmos architecture as well as be able to run and operate a chain of 1 node and set up the validator themselves.

1. Group 1: Starting a chain (Basic)
- [Lesson 1: Overview Cosmos-sdk and setup environment](docs/chapter_1/lesson_1.md)
- [Lesson 2: Make the first transaction](docs/chapter_1/lesson_2.md)    
- [Lesson 3: Interacting chain with CLI and config port](docs/chapter_1/lesson_3.md)
- [Lesson 4: Interacting chain with API and make transactions with lib Cosmjs](docs/chapter_1/lesson_4.md)
- [Lesson 5: Genesis file - Part 1](docs/chapter_1/lesson_5.md)
- [Lesson 6: Make Basic Chain](docs/chapter_1/lesson_6.md)
- [Lesson 7: Add Validator For Chain](docs/chapter_1/lesson_7.md)

In Group 2 (Advanced), learners will understand the data transmission architecture in Cosmos, develop themselves a data processing module to store in dababase for execution and querying.

2. Group 2: Custom Module Chain (Advanced)

- [Lesson 1: gRPC Model](docs/chapter_2/lesson_1.md)
- [Lesson 2: Make First Module](docs/chapter_2/lesson_2.md)
